# Programming for QA â€“ JavaScript

This folder contains my exercises and tasks from the **Programming for QA** course at **SoftUni**, where special attention is given to **JavaScript**.

## Topics Covered:

1. **Basic Syntax**:
   - Introduction to JavaScript syntax.
   - Variables, data types, and basic operations.
   - Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
   
2. **Arrays**:
   - Working with arrays: defining, accessing, and modifying.
  
3. **Functions**:
   - Defining functions, function parameters, and return values.
   - Arrow functions and function expressions.

4. **Objects**:
   - Creating and using objects in JavaScript.
   - Object properties and methods.
   - Working with `this` keyword in object contexts.

5. **Classes and Objects**:
   - Introduction to JavaScript Classes.
   - Creating instances of classes.
   - Class methods and constructors.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` for handling exceptions and errors in JavaScript code.

## Folder Structure:

The folder is organized into **3 subfolders**, each representing a different topic within this module of the course. Each subfolder contains tasks related to that topic:

- **JS-Basics**: Contains tasks related to JavaScript syntax, variables, conditionals, and loops.
- **JS-Fundamentals**: Contains tasks focused on more fundamental concepts, such as arrays and basic functions.
- **JS-Concepts-Exercise**: Contains tasks that explore more advanced JavaScript concepts, including objects, error handling, and object-oriented programming.

## How to Use:

- Clone or download the repository to access the exercises.
- Each task is organized by topics, and the files are named according to the module and task.
- The exercises range from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
  
## Future Tasks:

- More advanced JavaScript concepts like ES6 features, AJAX, and working with APIs.
- Testing JavaScript code and writing unit tests for better code quality.
