# 🧪 Programming for QA – JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository contains exercises, code examples, and notes from the **Programming for QA** course at **SoftUni**. The course focuses on building a strong foundation in **JavaScript programming**, specifically designed for future **Quality Assurance (QA)** engineers.

## 📌 Course Overview

The course introduces essential programming concepts that are crucial for understanding how software works, debugging code, and writing basic test scripts. The primary language used is JavaScript (ES6+), and the materials covered are geared toward QA-specific use cases.
