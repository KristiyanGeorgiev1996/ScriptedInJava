## 📚 Covered Topics

### 1️⃣ AJAX: Asynchronous Requests
Understanding how to fetch data from servers without reloading the page.  
- 🌐 Using `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` API for server communication.  
- 📦 Handling JSON responses and updating the UI dynamically.  
- ⚠️ Error handling for failed requests.

### 2️⃣ Promises: Managing Asynchronous Operations
Mastering the foundation of modern asynchronous programming in JavaScript.  
- 🔗 Creating and chaining Promises.  
- ⏱️ Using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` for flow control.  
- ⚡ Practical exercises for parallel and sequential promise execution.

### 3️⃣ Async/Await: Syntactic Sugar for Promises
Simplifying asynchronous code with cleaner syntax.  
- 🚀 Using `async` functions and `await` expressions.  
- 📝 Handling errors with `try/catch`.  
- 🧩 Combining async/await with generators and throttling techniques.  

### 4️⃣ DOM and Events: Dynamic Web Pages
Manipulating the Document Object Model and responding to user interactions.  
- 🖱️ Adding event listeners and handling events.  
- 🔄 Modifying DOM elements dynamically based on user input or asynchronous data.  
- 🏗️ Creating interactive UIs with JavaScript-driven updates.
